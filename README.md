When working with images, always deal with SVGs. Save SVGs as files in an `img`
folder next to the Markdown file the image is used in or in one of its parent
folders if that image will be used in other Markdown files in that part of the
file tree. Note that paths to images are relative to the Markdown file in which
the image is referenced.
