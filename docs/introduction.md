# Learn Computer Vision

## Introduction

> "What I cannot create, I do not understand." -Richard Feynman

This is open educational material for learning computer vision, starting with
rule-based techniques and ending with machine-learned ones. This provides a
curriculum for self-motivated learners and is designed to take someone from no
computer vision skills to having the fundamental skills and knowledge to learn
more specialized niches in the domain.

## Reading Guide

The material flows sequentially and so is designed to be worked through from
beginning to end. We will introduce theory, such as explaining some technique,
and then give you a programming challenge requiring you to implement and use the
technique often from scratch. We provide example solutions. The solutions are
not necessarily efficient or elegant but are meant to help you if you get stuck.
To get the most out of your learning experience, we encourage you to implement
everything on your own without referring to others' solutions as much as
possible.

## Prerequisites

You will need to know linear algebra and high school calculus to understand the
mathematical techniques. You will also need to know a general-purpose
programming language that ideally has robust math libraries available. Examples
are Python with [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and C++ with
[Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). For the
machine-learned portion of this material, you will also want a machine-learning
library.

Most if not all of our examples will be in Python and will make use of numpy and
then [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
